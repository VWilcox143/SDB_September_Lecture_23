# Traditional Databases

Database:
- Types: 
  - Relational 
    - SQL, PostgreSql, MySQL
  - Non-Relational
    - MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, Couchbase
- Collection of tables or documents
- Tables:
  - Primary Keys (ID)
  - Records: Data within rows of table
- Mongo
  - Database = Database
  - Collections = Tables
  - Documents = Records
    - stored as JSON
  - Is a **Document Data Store**

  # MERN
  - M: Mongo
    - database
  - E: Express
    - server
  - R: React
    -frontend/client
  - N: Node
    - everything in between

    # Express
- Need a `package.json` file
  - run `npm init` or `npm init -y`
- Install Dependencies:
  - Express: `npm i express`
  - Mongoose: `npm i mongoose`
    - package that connects to MongoDB
  - dotenv: `npm i dotenv`
  - **NOTE**:
    - We can install multiple dependencies at once
    - ex: `npm i express mongoose dotenv`
- Entry point within `package.json`
  - `index.js` or `app.js`
- `.gitignore`
  - ignore files/folders that shouldn't be in a repo.

  # .env
- Contains constants that are specific for our environment
- Stores items that we don't want published
  - passwords, port numbers / deployment routes, keys
- Should be added to `.gitignore`
- Should have a sample version to communicate with team.
  - `example.env`

  ## Mongo & Mongoose
- Need to connect to our database
  - Using **MongoDBCompass**
  - Stateful connection

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const MONGO = process.env.MONGODB;

mongoose.connect(`${MONGO}/moviedb`);

const db = mongoose.connection;

db.once("open", () => log(`Connected: ${MONGO}`));
```
